This file contains ideas based on code understanding

===========================================================
1) TT representation for inducing points
ref:
npde_helper2.py : line 27
"W: Integer denoting the width of the inducing point grid. If the problem
            dimension is D, total number of inducing points is W**D"

2) Kernel type => temporal evolving spatial kernels focusing on image processing
ref:
npde_helper2.py : line 29
"ktype: Kernel type. We have made experiments only with Kronecker kernel,
            denoted by 'id'. The other kernels are not supported."

3) optimization based on variational Bayes not only whitened U (inducing point functions : U = f(Z) )
ref:
npde_helper2.py : line 31
"whiten: Boolean. Currently we perform the optimization only in the
            white domain"
